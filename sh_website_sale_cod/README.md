About
============
Are you selling your products online? Do you want to provide a Cash on Delivery (COD) payment method to your customers? Currently, odoo does not provide a COD option for payment. This module will allow you to manage the cash-on-delivery feature on your website that provides convenience and flexibility to your customers, where traditional payment methods like credit cards or online banking are not widely used or preferred.

Installation
============
1) Copy module files to addon folder.
2) Restart odoo service (sudo service odoo-server restart).
3) Go to your odoo instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list. 
5) search module name and hit install button.
